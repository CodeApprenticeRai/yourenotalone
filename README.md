I created this website for MangoHacks 2017 (at FIU in Miami). 
The idea for the site was to be a place where depressed people could read notes of other depressed people and gain a sort of empathy, i.e. a feeling that they're not alone.  

This is the first site I've ever created, and I was really impressed with what I accomplished in those 24 hours of hacking.
With this project I learned the basics of HTML, CSS and how to serve dynamically with Flask.
